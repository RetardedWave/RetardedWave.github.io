So the bakery is where I go
Me and my cake at the table eating bites
eating fast and then we swallow slow
Come over and start up a conversation with just me
And trust me I'll give it a chance now
Take my hand, stop, put the cake on the table
And then we start to eat, and now I'm singing like
Cake, you know what I love
Your taste was handmade for somebody like me
Come on now, get inside me
I may be crazy, don't mind me
Say, hey, let's go eat too much
Grab on my fork and put yourself inside me
Come on now, get inside me
Come, come on now, get inside me
I'm in love with the taste of you
I eat cake like noone would do
Although my brothers want some too
I'm in love with your icing
And last night you were in my room
And now my bedsheets smell like you
Every day discovering something brand new
I'm in love with your icing
Oh—I—oh—I—oh—I—oh—I
I'm in love with your icing
Oh—I—oh—I—oh—I—oh—I
I'm in love with your icing
Oh—I—oh—I—oh—I—oh—I
I'm in love with your icing
Every day discovering something brand new
I'm in love with the taste of you
One week in we let the story begin
We're going out to get some cake
You and me are thrifty, i went all you can eat
filled up my stomach with more on my plate
We eat for hours and hours until the cake tastes sour
But still your chocolate is ok
Leave and get in a taxi, then eat in the backseat
Tell the driver to stop for more cake, and I'm singing like
Cake, you know what I love
Your taste was handmade for somebody like me
Come on now, get inside me
I may be crazy, don't mind me
Say, hey, let's go eat too much
Grab on my fork and put yourself inside me
Come on now, get inside me
Come, come on now, get inside me
I'm in love with the taste of you
I eat cake like noone would do
Although my brothers want some too
I'm in love with your icing
And last night you were in my room
And now my bedsheets smell like you
Every day discovering something brand new
I'm in love with your icing
Oh—I—oh—I—oh—I—oh—I
I'm in love with your icing
Oh—I—oh—I—oh—I—oh—I

Oh—I—oh—I—oh—I—oh—I
I'm in love with your icing
Every day discovering something brand new
I'm in love with the taste of you
Come on, get me cake please, come on
Come on, get me cake please, come on
Come on, get me cake please, come on
Come on, get me cake please, come on
Come on, get me cake please, come on
